An aestetic outcome showed up during my neuroimage processing in R exercises.

Source nifti file from ["Introduction to Neurohacking In R" course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurohacking). Source mask files are created with [FSLeyes software](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes). Gif is created with "convert" command line tool from [image magic](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php). For lovely colors [wesanderson color palettes](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) are used. 

Running main.r file will result a set of .png files and an output gif at export directory.
